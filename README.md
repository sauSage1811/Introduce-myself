Hi there! My name is Son. I was born in 2006 and I'm from Ha Tay province, Vietnam. Right now, I’d like to share a little bit about myself. I'm someone who’s always curious and eager to learn new things. Whether it's exploring technology, meeting new people, or taking on new challenges, I enjoy growing every day. This is just a quick introduction, but I hope it gives you a small glimpse of who I am at this point in my life.
